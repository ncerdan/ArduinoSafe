A 4-button code-based security system built and programmed with Arduino.

I did not have the hardware to attach this code to a piston or other
such motor in order to use it, but it successfully stored any custom
4 digit code and compared it to user input.

One can change the passcode only if they know the current code, thus ensuring basic security.
